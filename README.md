**Unlock the full power of any LLM inside GitHub Copilot.**

Tired of being locked into a single model? The LiteLLM Connector bridges the gap between VS Code's premier chat interface and the vast universe of models supported by LiteLLM. Whether it's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, or your own fine-tuned Llama 3 running locally—if LiteLLM can talk to it, Copilot can now use it.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting: Connection & On-boarding Issues 🚨

If you encounter issues where the extension fails to connect to LiteLLM or models do not appear in the picker after configuration:

1.  **Try Manual Configuration**: Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **`Manage LiteLLM Provider`**. This manually triggers the configuration workflow and often resolves state inconsistencies.
2.  **Check Connection**: Run the **`LiteLLM: Check Connection`** command to verify your Base URL and API Key are valid.
3.  **The "Nuke" Option**: if the extension state is completely corrupted, run **`LiteLLM: Reset All Configuration`** from the Command Palette. This will wipe all stored URLs and API keys, allowing you to start fresh.
4.  **Avoid Reinstalling**: Reinstalling the extension usually does **not** clear the underlying `SecretStorage` where your credentials are kept. Use the commands above instead.

## ⚠️ Important - Prerequisites ⚠️

To use this extension, **YOU MUST** have an active GitHub Copilot plan (the Free plan works). This extension utilizes the VS Code Language Model Chat Provider API, which currently requires a Copilot subscription. For more details, see the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/language-model-chat-provider).

## ✨ Features

* **🌍 Hundreds of Models**: Access any model configured in your LiteLLM proxy (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc.) directly from the Copilot model picker.
* **🌊 Real-time Streaming**: Experience smooth, instantaneous responses just like the native models.
* **🛠️ Tool Calling**: Full support for function calling, allowing models to interact with your workspace.
* **👁️ Vision Support**: Use image-capable models to analyze screenshots and diagrams directly in chat.
* **🧠 Smart Parameter Handling**: Automatically handles provider-specific quirks (like stripping `temperature` for O1) so you don't have to.
* **🔁 Automatic Retry on Unsupported Params**: If a model rejects a flag, the connector can strip unsupported parameters and retry.
* **📊 Token Tracking & Usage**: Real-time monitoring of input and output tokens for improved visibility into model costs and efficiency.
* **✍️ Git Commit Generation**: Generate structured commit messages from staged changes directly in the SCM view.
* **🧼 Smart Message Sanitization**: Automatically strips Markdown code blocks from generated commit messages for a cleaner SCM experience.
* **🔍 Connection Diagnostics**: Quickly verify your proxy configuration with the new `Check Connection` command.
* **⏱️ Inactivity Watchdog**: Optional timeout to keep long streams from hanging indefinitely.
* **🚫🧠 Cache Bypass Controls**: Send `no-cache` headers to bypass LiteLLM caching (with provider-aware exceptions).
* **🔐 Secure by Design**: Your API keys and URLs are stored safely in VS Code's `SecretStorage`.
* **⌨️ Optional Inline Completions**: Use LiteLLM for inline completions via VS Code’s stable inline completion API.

   * Enter your **API Key** (if required by your proxy).
4. **Select Model**:
   * Open the Copilot Chat view.
   * Click the model picker and look for the **LiteLLM** section.
5. **Start Chatting!**
